Cake Dungeon
=============

Cake dungeon is built on top of Watabou's Pixel Dungeon. It is esentially the same game, but with more foods, recipes, and, most importantly, cake!

To build the source, you will also need to include Watabou's game libraybut with the packages renamed from "com.watabou" to "com.github.mdsimmo"
